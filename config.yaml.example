# If hoursToRespond is specified, then a line will be drawn on
# time series graphs at the position specified; the idea here is
# that if you'd like to respond to PRs or issues within a certain

# and see whether you're meeting that. Defining this option will also
# make the list-of-issues (and PRs) widget show how many issues were 
# not responded to in this time.
